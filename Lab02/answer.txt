Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
A: No, it doesn't. Because both category and title are String so both constructors have the same signature and that is not allowed in Java.

Q: Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
A: I prefer passing an array since it is not limited to a number of items.
